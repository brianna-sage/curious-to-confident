      <h2>Body Discovery & Sexual Development</h2>
      <p>Adolescents experience surging hormones, increased body awareness, and heightened sexual desire. While these experiences can be confusing or overwhelming, they are a natural part of development.</p>
      <p>Estrogen and testosterone not only drive physical changes, but also increase interest in sexual connection. Parents should reinforce that intimacy involves more than just the body—it is also emotional and spiritual.</p>
      <div class="tip">
        👨‍👩‍👧 Parental Tip: “Your feelings and your desires are normal. Let’s talk about how to navigate them in healthy, respectful ways.”
      </div>
      <div class="moment">
        🗣 Real-life Teaching Moment: Watching a sex scene in a show? Ask: “Was this just physical? Or was there emotional connection too?”
      </div>
    </section>

      <h2>Gender Identity & Role Awareness</h2>
      <p>Teens are bombarded with gender expectations and stereotypes. Social media, friend groups, and dating culture all play a role. This is a critical time for helping them develop self-worth beyond appearance or conquest.</p>
      <table style="width:100%; border-spacing: 1rem;">
        <tr>
          <th style="text-align:left">Boys</th>
          <th style="text-align:left">Girls</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Pressure to objectify girls</td>
          <td>Pressure to conform to beauty standards</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>“Conquest = confidence” mentality</td>
          <td>May associate worth with attractiveness</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>The idea that “boys can’t control themselves” shifts responsibility onto girls. Boys must be taught to respect boundaries, regardless of a girl’s appearance. Girls must be reminded that worth goes far beyond physical beauty and should be encouraged to share their voice. Both should feel free to pursue interests regardless of gender stereotypes.</p>
      <div class="tip">
        👨‍👩‍👧 Parental Tip: Some teens experience same-sex attraction. Parents should prepare themselves to respond with love, support, and acceptance, ensuring their teen feels safe and valued.
      </div>
      <div class="moment">
        🗣 Real-life Teaching Moment: Your teen says, “Boys should always make the first move.” Ask, “Why do you think that? What might happen if girls felt more comfortable initiating too?”
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sexual Knowledge</h2>
      <p>Teens need factual, values-based education about safe sex, consent, contraception, and healthy relationships. These talks should build trust, not fear.</p>
      <div class="tip">
        👨‍👩‍👧 Parental Tip: “You don’t have to navigate this alone. I’ll never shame you for being curious or needing answers.”
      </div>
      <div class="moment">
        🗣 Real-life Teaching Moment: An awkward movie sex scene? Instead of fast-forwarding, ask: “What did they do right? What felt uncomfortable or unsafe?”
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Foundations for Future Relationships & Freedom from Shame</h2>
      <p>Teens are learning how to give and receive love, set boundaries, and develop sexual values. They need to hear that sex should be mutual, fun, safe, and never forced or shame-filled. Relationships should be rooted in respect and communication—not secrecy, pressure, or performance.</p>
      <div class="tip">
        👨‍👩‍👧 Parental Tip: “Sex is a sacred and joyful thing when approached with love, safety, and mutual trust.”
      </div>
      <div class="moment">
        🗣 Real-life Teaching Moment: Your teen asks, “Is it bad if I’m thinking about sex?” You might say, “No—that’s a normal part of growing up. Let’s talk about what those feelings mean and how to handle them with care.”
