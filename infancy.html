      <h2>Body Discovery & Early Sexual Development</h2>
      <p>Even as babies, children are curious about their bodies. They may begin to explore through touching themselves or others. This is completely normal and part of healthy development.</p>
      <div class="tip">
        👨‍👩‍👧 Parental Tip: If a child is openly touching themselves, say, “That’s something we do in private.” It’s important to use a calm, shame-free tone. It’s also normal for them to be curious!
      </div>
      <div class="moment">
        🗣 Real-life Teaching Moment: During diaper changes or bath time, use correct anatomical terms: “This is your vulva,” or “This is your penis.” It helps your child learn to speak clearly and confidently about their body.
      </div>

    <section>
      <h2>Gender Identity & Role Awareness</h2>
      <p>At this age, children start to recognize gender categories. They may point to others or label themselves based on what they observe.</p>
      <div class="tip">
        👨‍👩‍👧 Parental Tip: Encourage expression. If your toddler wants to play with dolls or wear different colors, let them! These actions don’t define their gender identity—they simply show curiosity.
      </div>
      <div class="moment">
        🗣 Real-life Teaching Moment: Your daughter wants to play with trucks? Your son puts on a tutu? Great! Respond with enthusiasm: “You’re exploring! What fun!”
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sexual Knowledge</h2>
      <p>While they may not understand sex, infants begin building trust and emotional safety. This lays the groundwork for future conversations about healthy intimacy and connection.</p>
      <div class="tip">
        👨‍👩‍👧 Parental Tip: Start now with body-positive messaging. Speak with comfort and calm around topics like private parts and physical closeness.
      </div>
      <div class="moment">
        🗣 Real-life Teaching Moment: When your child pulls down your shirt in public or grabs your body, say calmly, “That’s a private part of my body. We keep private parts covered.”
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Emotional Attachment & Foundations for Future Relationships</h2>
      <p>Secure attachment formed in infancy helps children feel safe, respected, and open to learning. The way parents respond to their child’s needs now shapes their ability to love and respect others later in life.</p>
      <div class="tip">
        👨‍👩‍👧 Parental Tip: When your baby cries or reaches for connection, respond with warmth. These interactions help them understand emotional intimacy.
      </div>
      <div class="moment">
        🗣 Real-life Teaching Moment: During feeding, cuddling, or rocking to sleep, narrate your actions: “I’m holding you close because I love you and want you to feel safe.”
