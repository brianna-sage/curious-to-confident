      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Even from birth, children begin to explore their bodies, absorb social cues, and develop emotional foundations for future relationships. This phase is not about introducing "the talk," but rather building trust, comfort, and confidence around bodies and affection.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Body Discovery & Sexual Development</h2>
      <p>Infants naturally explore their bodies—including genitals—as part of healthy sensory development. This is not sexual in an adult sense but is part of how they experience the world. They may begin to explore through touching themselves or others. This is completely normal and part of healthy development.</p>
      <div class="tip">💡 <strong>Parental Tip:</strong> If a child is openly touching themselves, say, “That’s something we do in private.” It’s important to use a calm, shame-free tone. It’s also normal for them to be curious!</div>
      <div class="moment">👨‍👩‍👧 <strong>Real-life Teaching Moment:</strong> During diaper changes or baths, say things like, “This is your vulva,” or “This is your penis.” These simple moments normalize accurate language.</div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Gender Identity & Social Influences</h2>
      <p>Even in infancy, children begin absorbing gender messages from how they are spoken to, dressed, and treated.</p>
      <div class="tip">💡 <strong>Parental Tip:</strong> Notice if you respond differently to your baby based on gender. Are you reinforcing stereotypes unknowingly?</div>
      <div class="moment">👨‍👩‍👧 <strong>Real-life Teaching Moment:</strong> If your toddler wants to play with dolls or wear different colors, let them! These actions don’t define their gender identity—they simply show curiosity.</div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sexual Knowledge, Safety & Consent</h2>
      <p>While they may not understand sex, infants begin building trust and emotional safety. This lays the groundwork for future conversations about healthy intimacy and connection.</p>
      <div class="tip">💡 <strong>Parental Tip:</strong> Start now with body-positive messaging. Speak with comfort and calm around topics like private parts and physical closeness.</div>
      <div class="moment">👨‍👩‍👧 <strong>Real-life Teaching Moment:</strong> When your child pulls down your shirt in public or grabs your body, say calmly, “That’s a private part of my body. We keep private parts covered.”</div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Emotional Attachment & Foundations for Future Relationships</h2>
      <p>Secure attachment formed in infancy helps children feel safe, respected, and open to learning. The way parents respond to their child’s needs now shapes their ability to love and respect others later in life.</p>
      <div class="tip">💡 <strong>Parental Tip:</strong> When your baby cries or reaches for connection, respond with warmth. These interactions help them understand emotional intimacy.</div>
      <div class="tip">💡 <strong>Parental Tip:</strong> During potty training, avoid shame-based comments. Gentle encouragement helps them feel confident in their body.</div>
      <div class="moment">👨‍👩‍👧 <strong>Real-life Teaching Moment:</strong> During feeding, cuddling, or rocking to sleep, narrate your actions: “I’m holding you close because I love you and want you to feel safe.”</div>
