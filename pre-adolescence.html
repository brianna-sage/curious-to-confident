    <section>
      <h2>Body Awareness</h2>
      <p>This is when puberty begins, and kids start noticing major changes in themselves and their peers. Many feel uncertain or self-conscious about these changes.</p>
      <div class="tip">
        👨‍👩‍👧 Parental Tip: Talk openly about changes in both boys and girls to promote empathy and mutual respect.
      </div>
      <div class="moment">
        🗣 Real-life Teaching Moment: During a casual moment (like brushing teeth or watching a show), mention, “Your body’s changing, and that’s totally normal.” If your child has pimples, say, “That happens to everyone. We can talk about ways to care for your skin.”
      </div>
      <table style="width:100%; border-spacing: 1rem;">
        <tr>
          <th style="text-align:left">Boys</th>
          <th style="text-align:left">Girls</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Testicular enlargement</td>
          <td>Breast development</td>

          <td>Pubic hair growth</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Voice deepening</td>
          <td>Menstruation begins</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Facial hair</td>
          <td>Body image focus may increase</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Gender Identity & Role Awareness</h2>
      <p>Hormonal changes can intensify emotional development and lead to shifts in how children see themselves and others. They may begin expressing more interest in the opposite sex—or experience same-sex attraction. These shifts are normal and should be met with support and curiosity, not fear.</p>
      <table style="width:100%; border-spacing: 1rem;">
        <tr>
          <th style="text-align:left">Boys</th>
          <th style="text-align:left">Girls</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Pressure to suppress emotions</td>
          <td>Pressure to focus on beauty</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Objectify girls/sexual conquest = status</td>
          <td>Associate worth with appearance</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>The idea that “boys can’t control themselves” shifts blame to girls and teaches boys they lack self-control. Let your child know you expect both genders to respect one another and value consent.</p>
      <div class="tip">
        👨‍👩‍👧 Parental Tip: Encourage mixed-gender friendships and group settings to help kids develop respect beyond attraction.
      </div>
      <div class="moment">
        🗣 Real-life Teaching Moment: Your child says, “Boys should always make the first move.” Ask, “Why do you think that is? What could happen if we changed that idea?”
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sexual Knowledge</h2>
      <p>This is a critical window to teach about anatomy, reproduction, pleasure, and consent—before media, peers, or pornography step in to fill the gaps. These conversations should be ongoing and age-appropriate.</p>
      <p>Understanding contraception: Both genders must clearly understand how pregnancy occurs and how it can be prevented. Boys are fertile 24/7, while girls are fertile only five days a month—so why is birth control seen as solely a girl’s responsibility? Open this discussion.</p>
      <p>Recommendation: <em>“Ejaculate Responsibly” by Gabrielle Blair</em> offers a refreshing take on male responsibility in contraception.</p>
      <div class="tip">
        👨‍👩‍👧 Parental Tip: “You can always come to me with questions. I won’t shame you for asking.”
      </div>
      <div class="moment">
        🗣 Real-life Teaching Moment: Watching a movie where a character is pressured into something? Pause and ask, “Was that a consensual decision? How would you have responded?”
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Media, Sexualization & Pornography</h2>
      <p>By this age, your child is likely to encounter sexualized media and possibly pornography. These exposures can distort their understanding of relationships, bodies, and consent. Be proactive, not reactive.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>📌 Pornography is addictive, and its effects are especially damaging to the developing brain.</li>
        <li>📌 It often shows harmful, non-consensual behavior as “normal.”</li>
        <li>📌 Exposure to pornography at young ages is linked to body dissatisfaction, shame, and anxiety.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="tip">
        👨‍👩‍👧 Parental Tip: Talk openly about what’s appropriate and exaggerated in media. Give guidance on how to navigate shows and games with awareness of false representation, and offer resources on how to develop healthy sexual attitudes.
      </div>
      <div class="moment">
        🗣 Real-life Teaching Moment: When you encounter a sexualized media scene, ask, “How do you think this affects the way people see love and intimacy?”
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Foundations for Future Relationships</h2>
      <p>Children need to know their worth isn’t tied to appearance, performance, or romantic attention. And they still need affection—even if they act like they don’t!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>💬 Fathers shouldn’t pull away from daughters just because they’re developing.</li>
        <li>💬 Boys still need physical affection, even if they resist hugs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Positively reinforce that sex should be fun, safe, built on trust, and always mutual. Discuss how healthy couples communicate boundaries outside of arousal and navigate intimacy together with respect.</p>
      <p>Don’t create extra sexualization: When you say “don’t look” or act ashamed, it often increases curiosity and secrecy. Instead, give your child a healthy framework to understand their reaction—and take responsibility for what they do with it.</p>
      <div class="tip">
        👨‍👩‍👧 Parental Tip: “You are lovable. You are worthy of love. You are enough exactly as you are.”
      </div>
      <div class="moment">
        🗣 Real-life Teaching Moment: If your child criticizes their appearance, respond with, “Your body is changing, and that’s normal. Your worth is in who you are, not just how you look.”
      </div>
