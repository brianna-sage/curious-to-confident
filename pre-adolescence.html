      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Pre-adolescence is a crucial transition phase marked by increased independence, stronger peer influence, and the early signs of puberty. Parents play a key role in helping kids navigate big changes while building confidence and open communication.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Body Awareness & Puberty Preparation</h2>
      <p>Children begin noticing body changes and comparing themselves to peers. Normalize variation in growth and explain puberty as a healthy, natural process.</p>
      <div class="tip">💡 <strong>Parental Tip:</strong> Talk proactively about body changes before they happen. This reduces anxiety and builds trust. Include both boys’ and girls’ development so your child learns to view the opposite sex with understanding and respect.</div>
      <div class="moment">👨‍👩‍👧 <strong>Real-life Teaching Moment:</strong> Casually bring up physical changes in everyday moments, like during car rides or while brushing teeth. If your child says, “I keep getting pimples,” reassure them this is a normal part of growing up and open the door for more conversation.</div>
      <div>
      <table style="width:100%; border-spacing: 1rem;">
        <tr>
          <th style="text-align:left">Boys</th>
          <th style="text-align:left">Girls</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Testicular enlargement</td>
          <td>Breast development</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Pubic hair growth</td>
          <td>Pubic hair growth</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Voice deepening</td>
          <td>Menstruation begins</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Facial hair</td>
          <td>Body image focus may increase</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Gender Identity & Peers</h2>
      <p>Hormonal changes may lead to increased interest in the opposite sex and exploration of identity. Kids often internalize gender stereotypes during this time—your voice matters in challenging these assumptions.</p>
      <table style="width:100%; border-spacing: 1rem;">
        <tr>
          <th style="text-align:left">Boys</th>
          <th style="text-align:left">Girls</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Pressure to suppress emotions</td>
          <td>Pressure to focus on beauty</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Objectify girls/sexual conquest = status</td>
          <td>Associate worth with appearance</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>Openly push back against these expectations. Emphasize emotional literacy and inner worth. The idea that “boys can’t control themselves” shifts blame to girls and teaches boys they lack self-control. Let your child know you expect both genders to respect one another.</td>
      <div class="tip">💡 <strong>Parental Tip:</strong> Encourage mixed-gender friendships and group settings to help kids develop respect for each other beyond attraction.</div>
      <div class="moment">👨‍👩‍👧 <strong>Real-life Teaching Moment:</strong> Ask open-ended questions like, “How do you feel when people say boys should act a certain way?” and listen with curiosity and support.</div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Sexual Knowledge, Safety & Consent</h2>
      <p>This is a critical window to teach about anatomy, reproduction, pleasure, and consent—before media, peers, or pornography step in to fill the gaps. These conversations should be ongoing and age-appropriate. Kids this age need accurate information about how bodies work, how babies are made, and what healthy boundaries look like. If you don’t teach them, someone else will—and often inaccurately.</p>
      <p>Understanding contraception: Both genders must clearly understand how pregnancy occurs and how it can be prevented. Boys are fertile 24/7, while girls are fertile only five days a month—so why is birth control seen as solely a girl’s responsibility? Open this discussion.</p>
      <p>Recommendation: <em>“Ejaculate Responsibly” by Gabrielle Blair</em> offers a refreshing take on male responsibility in contraception.</p>
      <div class="tip">💡 <strong>Parental Tip:</strong> Don’t wait for your child to ask—initiate conversations about reproduction, consent, and bodily autonomy in bite-sized, ongoing moments.</div>
     <div class="tip">
        💡 Parental Tip: “You can always come to me with questions. I won’t shame you for asking.”
      </div>
      <div class="moment">👨‍👩‍👧 <strong>Real-life Teaching Moment:</strong> Watching a movie where a character is pressured into something? Pause and ask, “Was that a consensual decision? How would you have responded?”</div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Media, Sexualization & Digital Access</h2>
      <p>Access to screens increases dramatically in this age group—along with exposure to unrealistic or sexualized portrayals of bodies and relationships. Children need tools to think critically and ask questions.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Pornography:</strong> Many kids are exposed to pornography at this age. Let them know it’s okay to talk to you if they see something confusing or upsetting. Explain that pornography doesn’t show real intimacy or love—it often distorts expectations, objectifies people, and can be addictive.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="tip">💡 <strong>Parental Tip:</strong> Talk openly about what’s appropriate and what’s exaggerated in media. Give guidance on how to navigate shows and games with awareness of false representation, and offer resources on how to develop healthy sexual attitudes.</div>
      <div class="moment">👨‍👩‍👧 <strong>Real-life Teaching Moment:</strong> When you encounter a sexualized media scene, ask, “How do you think this affects the way people see love and intimacy?” and invite your child to reflect out loud.</div>
      <div class="moment">👨‍👩‍👧 <strong>Real-life Teaching Moment:</strong> “You can always come to me with questions. I won’t shame you for asking.” </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Emotional Attachment & Foundations for Future Relationships</h2>
      <p>Children need to know their worth isn’t tied to appearance, performance, or romantic attention. And they still need affection—even if they act like they don’t!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>💬 Fathers shouldn’t pull away from daughters just because they’re developing.</li>
        <li>💬 Boys still need physical affection, even if they resist hugs.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Positively reinforce that sex should be fun, safe, built on trust, and always mutual. Discuss how healthy couples communicate boundaries outside of arousal and navigate intimacy together with respect.</p>
      <p>Don’t create extra sexualization: When you say “don’t look” or act ashamed, it often increases curiosity and secrecy. Instead, give your child a healthy framework to understand their reaction—and take responsibility for what they do with it.</p>
      <div class="tip">
        💡 Parental Tip: “You are lovable. You are worthy of love. You are enough exactly as you are.”
      </div>
      <div class="moment">
        👨‍👩‍👧 Real-life Teaching Moment: If your child criticizes their appearance, respond with, “Your body is changing, and that’s normal. Your worth is in who you are, not just how you look.”
